# Instructions  
This program displays a hot beverage menu and prompts the user to
make a selection. It is also a hot mess! A switch statement determines which item the user
has chosen. A do-while loop repeats until the user selects item E
from the menu.

Steps:
1: This program is a mess...bad structure. Fix the structure with proper indents. Maybe you can find a 3rd party IDE that might do it automatically? Or just manually fix it.
2: Fill in the indicated code using the comments to complete the program. Then compile and run the program several times with various inputs. Try all the possible relevant cases and record your results.
3: What do you think will happen if you do not enter A, B, C, D or E? Try running the program and inputting another letter.
